# 🤖 Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project builds an intelligent classification system to predict customer churn in a telecom company using Machine Learning.

The objective is to design a predictive AI model that identifies customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer churn significantly impacts business revenue.  
The goal of this project is to develop a robust AI-based classification model that can predict churn based on customer demographics, service subscriptions, and billing information.

## 📂 Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

Features include:
- Customer demographics
- Subscription services
- Billing details
- Contract type
- Churn status (Target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Data Engineering

- Converted `TotalCharges` to numeric format
- Handled missing values using median imputation
- Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding
- Performed Train-Test Split (80-20)
- Applied feature scaling where required

---

## 🤖 Model Development

### Algorithm Used:
Random Forest Classifier

### Why Random Forest?
- Handles mixed numerical & categorical data
- Reduces overfitting using ensemble learning
- Provides high classification accuracy

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- Accuracy: ~80%
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix

The model successfully identifies high-risk customers with strong predictive performance.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Customers with month-to-month contracts have higher churn rates.
- Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn probability.
- Contract type plays a major role in customer retention.
